# file explanation:
## `.csv`:
- `arcgis.csv`, `geodb.csv`, `s123.csv` are original dataset and has never been modified. (Sources: ARCGIS, GeoDataBase, Survery 123; refer this to csv with same names)
- others are dataframe produced during data processing and analysis.

## ~~`google.py`~~
Origianlly for upload and retriveing images into google drive using google drive API, not implemented due to error. You can now find the complete images [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15413UnRxppB0gas0pJ9VQGSxnj8uQqV7?usp=sharing)
