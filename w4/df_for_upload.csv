539,585,,"Tide's been out but the flooding remains 6 hours later in the middle of 164th Ave. DEP cleared the sewer lines and storm drain boxes. Obviously that's not enough since the possible collapse of piping between the storm drains and the canal won't allow the standing water to properly flow. The block is incorrectly pitched as well with a low spot effecting at least 8 homes including ours and neighbors. Worth mentioning, there's a speed bump pile of black top about 100 feet from the canal end which doesn't help drainage either. This is what 164th Avenue deals with be it rain, high tide, or both together. Merry Christmas West Hamilton!
