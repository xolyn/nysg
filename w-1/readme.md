# file explanation:
## `.csv`:
- `o.arcgis.csv`, `geodb.csv` are original dataset and has never been modified.
- `arcgis.csv` is a slighted modified version of `o.arcgis.csv` (also same as [`arcgis.csv`](../w4/arcgis.csv) in previous week's folder)
- others are dataframe produced during data processing and analysis.
## `.+\.txt`:
Outouts of the form output from `upload.ipynb`. File names are semantic.
- `form_output.txt` is the final output (total 724, concatenated)

## `test.cs`:
A test on C# env, you may ignore it.
